# Battleship-game
An adapted version of Battleships that involves avoiding 'bombs' whilst trying to locate ships. It should be implemented using a NUCLEO-G071RB.
To implement the game, the following set-up is required:

Create a 3x3 grid of leds (colour is not important) with two leds beside it, a red one and a green one (they have to be those colours). These should all be connected to the corresponding pins on the board by a wire and then connected to ground through 330 ohm resistors.

There should also be a joystick that is connected to the board using female-to-male dupont wires and it can be moved around to allow for left and right handed players.
